# LEGO® Set Hackathon

<style>@import url("//readme.codeadam.ca/readme.css");</style>

For this task you will be working in groups. Your groups have been set randomly in [Blackboard](https://learn.humber.ca).

The [BrickMMO](http://brickmmo.com/) smart city built with LEGO® bricks has many official LEGO kits integrated into the city.

As the city grows we will integrate more and more sets into the smart city. We would like to integrate a varity of interactive components. In this task you will choose an official LEGO set and design an interactive component.

You will not be building and coding the interactive component. This is only a brainstorming session. Your concept may be completed by another groups of students in the future.

In the past students have designed the following:

### Loop Coaster

The [Loop Coaster](https://www.lego.com/en-ca/product/loop-coaster-10303) that will run the ride on command:
