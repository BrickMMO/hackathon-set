The [BrickMMO](http://brickmmo.com/) smart city built with LEGO® bricks has many official LEGO kits integrated into the city.

As the city grows we will integrate more and more sets into the smart city. We would like to integrate a variety of interactive components into these kits. In this task you will choose an official LEGO set and design an interactive component.

You will not be building and coding the interactive component. This is only a brainstorming session. Your concept may be completed by another group of students in the future.

## Examples

Here are a few examples from past cohorts:

### Loop Coaster

The [Loop Coaster](https://www.lego.com/en-ca/product/loop-coaster-10303) that will run the ride on command or at a timed interval:

### Infinity Gauntlet

### Documentation

Each year we convert past hackathon PDFs to Markdown in the hopes that they will be programmed into the BrickMMO Smart City:

- [12 Grimmauld Place](12-grimmauld-place)

## Steps

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Browse the official [LEGO Store](https://www.lego.com/en-ca/themes) and choose a set.

   > You could also choose an alternative build:  
   > [https://rebrickable.com/sets/alternates/](https://rebrickable.com/sets/alternates/)

2. Brainstorm how this set can be adjusted to become interactive.
3. Brainstorm which sensors, motors, and lights will be required to integrate the concept.

   > Checkout a list of available sensors and motors  
   > [https://brickmmo.github.io/media/sensors-motors](https://brickmmo.github.io/media/sensors-motors)

4. Write the [pseudocode](https://pseudocode.codeadam.ca) for your interaction.

5. Document this interactive concept using the Google Docs template.

   > You can download a copy of this template  
   > [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gknSInaIIco2ORqP4cA35TlsDo5pSZ863Nm8OcLPfaI](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gknSInaIIco2ORqP4cA35TlsDo5pSZ863Nm8OcLPfaI)

6. Add your document to the [hackathon-set](https://github.com/BrickMMO/hackathon-set/) repo. You can add your PDF document to the `results` folder.

   You will need to fork the repo, add your changes, and submit a pull request.

> There are additional instructions available  
> [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WuzV2EYVZtyCNLB8IXAAnArWCqiddQ56KWc52wX0XHU](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WuzV2EYVZtyCNLB8IXAAnArWCqiddQ56KWc52wX0XHU)

## Submitting this Task

Once your instructor has merged your pull request, submit a link to your PDF to the **Set Hackathon** assignment in [Blackboard](https://learn.humber.ca/).
