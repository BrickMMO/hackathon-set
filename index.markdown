The [BrickMMO](http://brickmmo.com/) smart city built with LEGOÂ® bricks has many official LEGO kits integrated into the city.

As the city grows we will integrate more and more sets into the smart city. We would like to integrate a varity of interactive components into these kits. In this task you will choose an official LEGO set and design an interactive component.

You will not be building and coding the interactive component. This is only a brainstorming session. Your concept may be completed by another group of students in the future.

## Examples

In the past students have designed the following:

- [12 Grimmauld Place](12-grimmauld-place.markdown)

### Loop Coaster

The [Loop Coaster](https://www.lego.com/en-ca/product/loop-coaster-10303) that will run the ride on command or at a timed interval:
